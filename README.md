UK Highways Agency Live Data Archive
====================================

This repository will only cover the seven days from April 20, 2013. Any more is
a waste of data storage on GitHub given my needs.

An automatically updated historical record of [traffic
data](http://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/live-traffic-information-from-the-highways-agency-road-network)
published by the UK Highways Agency. The data is in the form of several XML
databases. Each update to the database is recorded as a commit in the version
history. The databases are re-indented to make them more diff-friendly.

All data is re-published under the terms of the [Open Government
Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/).

This mirroring service is not in any way affiliated with the UK Government. It
exists only for a personal project. Although data is updated at 10 minute
intervals, it may take up to an hour for the data to be mirrored to this
repository. For real time data, use the service directly.
